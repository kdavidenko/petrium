# Petrium
A game in which you take the role of a green bacterium trying to survive in this oddly rectangular petri dish.

## Controls
A or LeftArrow - rotate left
D or RightArrow - rotate right
Spacebar - begin motion

Once you start moving, you cannot stop.

## Objectives
Consume (run into) the purple-violet food particles, this will slowly increase your size, making it possible for you to eat enemy bacterium (they will turn a similar color to the food particles)

Once all enemy bacteria are eaten, the level is over and a new one will be set up.

## Purpose
Created to experiment with canvas and classes


## Known Bugs
- Sometimes the direction of an enemy bacterium will repeatedly reverse with each frame when near food, causing it to freeze in place until the food is eaten.
